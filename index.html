                <h3>Tic-Tac-Toe Web Application</h3>
                <p>Build an interactive tic-tac-toe game using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This web application enables users to play the timeless game of tic-tac-toe with either another player or an AI opponent. <br><br>

                    HTML provides the structure of the game board and user interface elements. You’ll define a grid layout for the tic-tac-toe board, consisting of nine cells where players will place their markers. <br><br>
                    
                    CSS is used to style the game board and markers, ensuring the interface is visually appealing and user-friendly. You’ll add styles for the grid, cell borders, and marker symbols (X and O), enhancing the overall user experience. <br><br>
                    
                    JavaScript handles the interactive aspects of the game. It includes functions to manage user inputs, track the game state (turns and markers), and evaluate winning conditions. JavaScript will manage the logic for checking rows, columns, and diagonals for a win or a draw, and update the game interface accordingly. <br><br>
                    
                    The end result is a fully functional tic-tac-toe game that is not only visually engaging but also provides interactive gameplay, with features to support playing against an AI or another human player.</p>

                <h3>Stopwatch Web Application</h3>
                <p>To build a stopwatch web application, you'll utilize HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a functional and visually appealing tool for measuring time intervals. <br><br>

                    HTML forms the foundation by structuring the application elements, such as the display area for the stopwatch, control buttons (start, pause, reset), and optional lap time indicators. <br><br>
                    
                    CSS is employed to style the stopwatch, ensuring an intuitive and attractive interface. You'll use CSS to adjust the layout, colors, and typography, making the stopwatch easy to read and use. <br><br>
                    
                    JavaScript powers the stopwatch's functionality. It handles the core operations, including starting, pausing, and resetting the timer. JavaScript also manages the calculation of elapsed time, updates the display, and tracks lap times, providing users with accurate and dynamic timekeeping capabilities. <br><br>
                    
                    Together, these technologies allow you to create an interactive stopwatch application that is both user-friendly and effective for timing various activities.</p>
